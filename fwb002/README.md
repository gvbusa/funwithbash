# CRUD functions for mongodb
db_mongo.sh provides functions to perform CRUD operations for a collection in mongodb.
The MONGO_URI should be modified as required for your mongodb database. It is currently 
populated with a value that points to a mongo atlas free tier cluster, and database in it
called "fwb".
MONGO_USERNAME and MONGO_PASSWORD are expected to be available in environment variables.
